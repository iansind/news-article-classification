# news-article-classification

This projects takes a look at using non-negative matrix factorization to tackle text classification problems. The notebook "BBC_text_classification.ipynb" utilizes NMF to identify the keywords associated with different categories of news articles. The NMF model is then used to predict classes of a test dataset of news articles. This approach is then compared to two traditional methods of supervised learning classification. 

The Jupyter notebook thoroughly documents the processes as they are performed.
