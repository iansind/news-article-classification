# news-article-classification

This projects takes a look at using non-negative matrix factorization to tackle text classification problems. The primary notebook is "BBC_text_classification.ipynb", which utilizes NMF to identify the keywords associated with different categories of news articles. The NMF model is then used to predict classes of a test dataset of news articles. This approach is then compared to two traditional methods of supervised learning classification. 

The second notebook, "Movie_ratings_NMF.ipynb", takes a brief and shallow look at the application of NMF to a rating system and discusses some of the drawbacks of this approach. 

The Jupyter notebooks thoroughly document the processes as they are performed.
